# AI-NI-Datathon - Building AI to Unlearn Bias in Recruitment (Queen's or Ulster, Magee)
Welcome to the AI NI Datathon! This challenge is considering methods of AI and data mining that can identify bias in data and trying to explore the methods to be used when you don't have _clean_ data! What happens if we don't preprocess data and identify any bias? How would we be able to rely on an AI/ML algorithm? This repo contains all info you might need through our challenge!

What happens if the data is not what you expect? 

*Can you create different scenarios to see how models behave in different situations? Can you filter and subset to increase bias?*

## Workshop Slides - Dirty Data or Biased Data?

The workshop is at 1.30 on Sat! Slide links will be uploaded after the talk!
